QUESTION:
Write a program to find the sum of digits in a given number. 
Program to find the sum of digits of the given number is discussed here. 
For example, let the input number be 719. The sum of digits of 719 = 7 + 1 + 9 = 17
'''

# PROGRAM (Answer):

# 1st Method
n = int(input())
sum=0
while n>0:
    rem = n%10
    sum = sum+rem
    n=n//10
print(sum)


'''
# 2nd Method (Taking input as a String)
n=input()
sum=0
for i in n:
    sum=sum+int(i)
print(sum)
'''

'''
# 3rd Method (Taking input as a String)
n=input()
sum=0
for i in range(0,len(n)):
    sum=sum+int(n[i])
print(sum)
