# PROGRAM (Answer):

# 1st Method
a = int(input())
n = a
pal = 0
while n >0:
    r=n%10
    pal = pal*10 + r
    n = n//10
if a == pal:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not a Palindrome")

'''    
2nd Method
n = input()
rev = n[::-1]
if n == rev:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not a Palindrome")
