QUESTION:
Write a program to find the sum of numbers in a given range is discussed here. 
Given the starting and ending interval, the sum of all the numbers in that range will be displayed as output.

For example,
Input: 1 10
Output: 55
Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of two integers.
First input consists of the start value.
Second input consists of the end value.
Output consists of the sum of range.

Sample Input 1:
1
10

Sample Output 1:
55

'''

# PROGRAM (Answer):

#1st Method
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
k=0
for i in range(a,b+1):
    k=k+i
print(k)

'''
#2nd Method
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a-1
p=int(c*(c+1)/2)
q=int(b*(b+1)/2)
print(q-p)
