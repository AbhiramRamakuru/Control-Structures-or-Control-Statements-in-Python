# PROGRAM (Answer):

#1st Method to write this program
n = int(input())
pal = 0
while n >0:
    r=n%10
    pal = pal*10 + r
    n = n//10
print(pal)

'''
#2nd Method to write this program
def rev(n,ans):
    if n == 0:
        return ans
    else:
        rem = n%10
        ans = ans*10 + rem
        n=n//10
        return rev(n,ans)
        
a = int(input())
print(rev(a,0))

'''
#3rd Method to write this program
